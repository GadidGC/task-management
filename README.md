# Ravn React Task Management App

Welcome to the Ravn React Task Management App project! This application allows users to manage tasks efficiently, featuring a clean and intuitive interface. Below you'll find all the necessary information to set up and run the project, along with a summary of the implemented features and technologies used.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript

- Next.js (app)

- Apollo Client

- Bun / Bun test: first-time using this tool recommended.

- GraphQL Codegen: Essential for maintaining end-to-end type safety with the provided GraphQL endpoint.

- @tanstack/react-table: Crucial component as each task represents a row, serving as a core headless toolkit for implementing filters, sorting, virtualizations, and pagination.

- dnd-kit/core: Highly recommended over dnd-react due to its superior support for touch and mouse events, eliminating the need for separate logic for each drag-and-drop operation.

- Zod / React Hook Form: Essential for creating schemas to validate data before sending it to the backend, ensuring client-side validation and error management.

- Prettier / Husky

- Shadcn

## Key Highlights

- Avoid using Apollo Client with Next.js due to its experimental stage and issues with end-to-end safety, as it doesn't effectively work with edge runtime and integration with Next.js poses challenges.

- While the main motivation for using Apollo with GraphQL was strong, a significant issue arose with the need to explicitly declare types generated by GraphQL-gen.

- Despite local cache updates for creating and deleting tasks, there were issues with not refreshing all tasks. This led to the decision to utilize Apollo Client due to its seamless integration with GraphQL, enabling efficient local optimizations without the need for wrappers.

- Attempting to utilize server components, particularly for rendering all tasks on the server and then sending them to the client, proved inadequate as the server should update data with each request, particularly for updating the board.

- Integration of dnd-core/kit initially seemed promising, requiring only around 20 minutes for drag-and-drop functionality. However, issues arose when attempting to interact with task options, such as edit or delete buttons, due to click events being mistaken for drag-and-drop events. This required modifying the trigger delay.

- Utilizing Bun for the first time proved beneficial for its speed, particularly when deployed on Vercel's serverless functions. This JavaScript runtime was indispensable for faster build times for each lambda and executing logic efficiently.

## Setup and Running Instructions

Prerequisites:

Install [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `bun install`.
4. Start the development server with `bun dev`.
5. Access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
6. The easiest way to deploy the Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
